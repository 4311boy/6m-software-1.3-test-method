## Brief

### Lesson Overview

We will be spending the first hour to learn about software testings, and next 2 hours on quick JavaScript lesson and assignment. At the end of the assignment, learners will see a short demo on unit test within the [assignment](./assignment) folder.

Command to run test:

```sh
npm run test 
```

If you face issue running `jest` in the `devDependency`, a quick remedy is to run `npm i -g jest` first.

### Note

- Run all `.js` files with `node` in the Terminal.
